# .vimrc
Import the lines from the file into your `.vimrc` file to access the shortcuts for creating a new card template / annotating the current displayed pdf page. 

Shortcuts: 
* `,c`: create a new card template. Since it's vim use prepend a number for a whole stack of cards.
* `,p`: paste the number of the currently displayed page in the pdf viewer. The Backend will be able to translate it into an img-html-tag.
